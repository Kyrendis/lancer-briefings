# MSMC TRANSPORT CARRIER // 5.24.5012U
An experimental ship created by **SSC**â€™s biowarfare division has crash landed while transiting through a minor border system  on the planet **DORADA**. You are new recruits of Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company, and have been put together under a Commanding Officer operating as your handler, Callsign **STARLINER**. 

Your ship is the only one close enough to reach the ruins of the SSC vessel before local subversive elements may have a chance to recover high level **CORPSEC** research material. The damage they could do with that kind of tech is incalculable. Local bandit/raider group **DESERT TIGER** is known to have a hidden base on **DORADA**. Your instructions are to prevent any **SSC** research material from falling into unapproved hands by any means necessary. Retrieval of goods, if at all possible, is a secondary priority.
