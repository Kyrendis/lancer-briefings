R-66 has been created to die and be replaced by a better version of himself. He is the product of an iterative cloning program, where the faults that lead to the downfall of one version are corrected in the next. His number is his current iteration, the clone who replaced R-65. He knows all this, but does not resist his destiny, as his creators maintain leverage over him; his wife, P-55, is another product of the program. Her safety is assured as long as he carries out his mission, as only one of their genetic lines needs to succeed for the program to be a success. It is for this reason he has never raised his case with HR/DoJ.

R-66 has never adopted a more human name, feeling his actions should define him more as an individual than his name, homeworld, cultural or religious background, or genetic lineage. In the end, if he makes it to old age, that will define him far more than anything else in the eyes of his creators.
